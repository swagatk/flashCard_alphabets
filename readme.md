# Alphabet Flashcards
A simple alphabet flashcard application for toddlers.

I am using the following capabilities here:
- listview
- recyclerview
- card view
- floating action buttons for navigation
- Text to speech interface

The APK file is available under `app/release/` folder. Click [here](app/release/app-release.apk) to download the APK file.

### Tests 
- The app has been tested to work properly on Motorolla G7 Power running Android 10 os.
- The app also works fine on Fire 7 table running on Fire OS 8.3.1.2.
